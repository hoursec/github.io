			Hoursec Energy Efficient AI-On-Chip technology was born after a neuroscientific research invention that went through fortunate steps for 
			implementation that shaped us as an Innovative Startup. This gave us the breakthrough to reduce in a factor of three thousand (3000X), the 
			energy requirements for AI workloads. With Hoursec, our customers have sustainable training and inference for real-time Business Decisions.
			Hoursec inspiration on Synaptic functioning, allow us to MAXIMIZE the ratio of information transmission given by the flexibility and high 
			throughput that is characteristic of how the brain works. Thanks to our theoretical re-thinking for computation, we have a granular approach
			to simulate Complex Systems for IoT and Edge Computing. Our sustainable AI-On-Chip platform offers Optimization and Analytics from the Data 
			Center to Edge devices.

				  From the well know claim "AI is the new electricity." -Andrew Ng, Founder of AI Fund and backer of FourthBrain to "Hoursec is the
				  new sustainable AI that consumes less electricity"

				  Our unique AI deployments not only reduce the amount of energy but also the data required for training and inference which 
				  protects the privacy of the data owner not only by cryptographic measurements but given our off-Cloud communication scheme. 
				  We are inspired by the Brain and its mechanisms for sensing and projecting at the fastest precisions in time and space while 
				  creating a continuous projection of what we see, heard, feel, smell and communicate.

				We are collaborating with Research Institutions for the development of AI solutions at the extreme Edge, where latencies of 
				nanoseconds are crucial during physical experiments and trading simulations. Our real-time inference at the edge can also be used 
				as a platform for robust risk analysis and predictive maintenance strategy for saving costs during manufacturing process.

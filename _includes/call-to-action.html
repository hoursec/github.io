Hoursec Enhancing Computing technology was born after a research invention that went through fortunate steps for implementation and shaped us as an Innovative Startup. We reduce in three thousand percent the energy requirements for Deep Neural Network models training and inference requirements. This guarantees the reduction in data storage and movement for data analysis. Hoursec inspiration on Synaptic functioning, allow us to MAXIMIZE the ratio of information transmitted per epoch. Thanks to our theoretical re-thinking for an Optimal Algorithmic Design Tool, we have a granular approach to Complex Systems. We also have the Datacenter approach on the sense of blending Optimization and Analytics but we have the resources of a Startup, this is what make us resourceful and fast, just at the edge.

			 us resourceful and fast, just at the edge. Our unique AI deployments not only reduces the amount of data but protects the privacy of
			 the end-user not only by cryptographic measurements but as a consequence of Optimizations in data storage and communication to the Cloud,
			 We are inspired by the Brain and its mechanisms for sensing and projecting at the fastest precisions in time and space to create a
			 continuous projection of what we feel, smell and communicate.

                        We are working on AI products for Enhancing the data analysis of physical experiments of High Energy Physics and simulation. Not only
			 inferring at the edge but under refined robust detection and analysis. Our products are rooted in an Optimal Algorithm Design Tool
			 applied to Tasks where it is necessary to have inference in real-time and for Healthcare applications where imaging detection and
			 therapy need to communicate in a feedback loop.

                <p class="text-muted">Hoursec is an innovative machine learning architecture that reduces by up to 80% 
                    the amount of data needed for training learning algorithms, as a consequence, for the first time 
                    in the semiconductor industry, we are capable of doing both, training and inference on a same chip. 
                    As a first application for our breakthrough, we are creating an AI- assisted real-time processing 
                    of data transmission in parallel with inference processing.  Continuous training, error-correction, 
                    and inference in real time.  Consequently, we aim to reduce energy required for computation â€“ lower 
                    power, faster simultaneous training and inference.  Depending on the size requirements of our 
                    customers, we can offer a plug and play solution from the centimeter-scale to the nanometer-scale 
                    for deployments in the proximity of sensors and actuators. The flexibility for miniaturization, 
                    expands our investment and customer opportunities.</p>

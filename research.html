            Current Deep learning Models can only achieve outperforming results using a lot of Data. Learning and Processing this data is time and Energy 
		  consuming which is a problem for digital enterprises since the need to store and process data is expensive. We achieve those requirements
		  with less resources.
	 <br/>
	 <br/>
	 Hoursec focus of research and expertise is on Neural Systems and Computation with an emphasis on Information theory, Neurotechnologies and Quantum 
		  inspired algorithms. Our research and technological improvements are at the stage where we can offer real time ML-smarter decision making at the
		  hand of our customers. Why do we do it? We want to give control and speed to the user, not the machine. 
		  This aligns with our social motivation since a smarter design set of algorithms give us a personal, private and free from recommendation systems
		  space.

		  "Fears are part of our identity, when we navigate our life's voyage, we know that when the storm comes, it is going to take you to the bone
		  and if the storm keeps coming you gotta stand up. It is just what you gotta do and it is in this zone where you learn to make fear your best
		  friend, you hold it really close to you and you open up that door to believing that you can make it". Hoursec low data analysis tool, open
		  this door by releasing your decisions from machines and we make it fast.
